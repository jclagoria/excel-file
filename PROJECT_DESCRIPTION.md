## Project Description

### 1. Overall Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a backend service for uploading and processing Microsoft Excel files. It allows users to submit Excel files, which are then parsed and transformed into a structured data format (a list of maps) that can be utilized by other parts of an application or returned to the user.

### 2. Technology Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

*   **Programming Language:** Java
*   **Framework:** Spring Boot
*   **Key Libraries:**
    *   `spring-boot-starter-web`: For building RESTful web services.
    *   Apache POI: For handling `.xls` and `.xlsx` Excel file formats.
    *   `xlsx-streamer`: A library built on top of Apache POI for efficiently streaming and processing large XLSX files, which helps in reducing memory consumption.

### 3. Key Components and Their Roles

The project is structured into several key components, each with a distinct responsibility:

*   **`ExcelUploadApplication.java`**: This is the main class of the Spring Boot application. It contains the `main` method, which serves as the entry point to start the application. It's typically annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` to enable auto-configuration, component scanning, and other Spring Boot features.
*   **`UploadController.java`**: This class acts as the entry point for HTTP requests related to file uploads.
    *   It is annotated with `@RestController`, indicating that it handles incoming web requests.
    *   It defines an endpoint, typically `/upload` (or similar), that accepts HTTP POST requests.
    *   It takes a `MultipartFile` object as a request parameter, which represents the uploaded Excel file.
    *   Its primary role is to receive the file and delegate the processing logic to the `UploadService`.
*   **`UploadService.java`**: This service class encapsulates the core business logic for processing the uploaded Excel files.
    *   It is typically annotated with `@Service` to indicate that it's a service component managed by Spring.
    *   It receives the `MultipartFile` from the `UploadController`.
    *   It uses libraries like Apache POI or `xlsx-streamer` to read the data from the Excel file, row by row, and cell by cell.
    *   It transforms the data into a `List<Map<String, String>>`, where each map represents a row from the Excel sheet (with column headers as keys and cell content as values).
    *   It may include error handling, data validation, and other processing steps.
*   **`build.gradle`**: This file is the build script for the project, managed by Gradle.
    *   It defines project metadata, such as `group`, `version`.
    *   It specifies the dependencies required for the project, including:
        *   `spring-boot-starter-web`: For Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat.
        *   `org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml`: For working with modern Excel (`.xlsx`) files.
        *   `com.monitorjbl:xlsx-streamer`: For efficient streaming of large `.xlsx` files.
        *   Test dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-test`.
    *   It configures plugins, such as the Spring Boot Gradle plugin, which helps in building executable JARs or WARs.
*   **Other Packages (e.g., `model`, `enums`, `util`)**:
    *   `model`: Likely contains Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) or data transfer objects (DTOs) that represent the structure of the data being processed or returned.
    *   `enums`: May contain enumeration types used within the application (e.g., for specific categories, statuses).
    *   `util`: Could house utility classes with helper methods used across different parts of the application (e.g., for string manipulation, date formatting, or custom Excel parsing logic).

### 4. Expected Workflow

The typical workflow of the application is as follows:

1.  **File Upload:** A user or an external client sends an HTTP POST request to the `/upload` endpoint, with an Excel file included in the request body as `multipart/form-data`.
2.  **Request Handling:** The `UploadController` receives the incoming request. The `MultipartFile` containing the Excel data is extracted from the request.
3.  **Service Delegation:** The `UploadController` passes the `MultipartFile` to the `UploadService`.
4.  **Excel Processing:** The `UploadService` uses Apache POI and potentially `xlsx-streamer` to:
    *   Open and read the Excel file.
    *   Iterate through the sheets, rows, and cells.
    *   Extract the data, typically treating the first row as headers and subsequent rows as data records.
    *   Convert each row into a `Map<String, String>`, where keys are column headers and values are the corresponding cell values (as strings).
    *   Aggregate these maps into a `List<Map<String, String>>`.
5.  **Response Generation:** The `UploadService` returns the `List<Map<String, String>>` to the `UploadController`.
6.  **HTTP Response:** The `UploadController` serializes the list of maps (usually into JSON format) and sends it back to the client as the body of the HTTP response with a success status code (e.g., 200 OK). If any errors occur during processing, an appropriate error response (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) would be returned.
